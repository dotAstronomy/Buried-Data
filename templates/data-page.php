                <p>Many of us have data that - if we're honest - is unlikely to see the light of day. It might have been neglected as we moved from job to job, and from place to place, or we might just have been distracted. Collaborators move on, or even leave astronomy, and their data stays behind. What if there was a place to leave your orphaned raw data, half-reduced data, or half-written papers? BuriedData.org is a halfway house and a refuge for data in need of care and attention.
